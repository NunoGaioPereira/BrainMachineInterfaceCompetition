# BrainMachineInterfaceCompetition

This repository is a decoder for continuous position estimation by classifying neural data from monkeys. Spike trains from the motor cortex neurons of monkeys were previously recorded during reaching movements in different directions. The model uses linear regression in combination of k-nearest neighbours classification.

This was developed as part of the Brain Machine Interface course in MEng Biomedical Engineering degree in Imperial College London.
